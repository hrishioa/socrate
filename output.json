Now, if we want to talk about adapting ideas to different contexts or industries, we need to focus on what makes America great. We need to focus on our innovation, our entrepreneurship, and our can-do spirit. We need to cut regulations and lower taxes to encourage businesses to invest in America. And we need to put America first in all of our trade deals. That's how we're going to keep winning, folks."
